I've used the Asda app for years. I used to be able to click on individual items in previous orders and add them to my shop. Now you can't do that and if you try to add an entire previous trolley, it wipes what is currently in it! Each item you add now has to be searched for individually. More time consuming and not helpful anymore!\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","\u001b[37m  \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[94m\"repliedAt\"\u001b[39;49;00m:\u001b[37m \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[34mnull\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","\u001b[37m  \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[94m\"replyContent\"\u001b[39;49;00m:\u001b[37m \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[34mnull\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","\u001b[37m  \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[94m\"reviewCreatedVersion\"\u001b[39;49;00m:\u001b[37m \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[33m\"23.01.03\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","\u001b[37m  \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[94m\"reviewId\"\u001b[39;49;00m:\u001b[37m \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[33m\"1752d5cc-e67c-40e7-bf38-cda11b5630e3\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","\u001b[37m  \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[94m\"score\"\u001b[39;49;00m:\u001b[37m \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[34m1\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","\u001b[37m  \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[94m\"sortOrder\"\u001b[39;49;00m:\u001b[37m \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[33m\"most_relevant\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","\u001b[37m  \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[94m\"thumbsUpCount\"\u001b[39;49;00m:\u001b[37m \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[34m111\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","\u001b[37m  \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[94m\"userImage\"\u001b[39;49;00m:\u001b[37m \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[33m\"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/AAcHTtddef8mS7D8BLsKbyF5QYlwbhDnKU4aWWZ1IVSbQzaKjg=mo\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","\u001b[37m  \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[94m\"userName\"\u001b[39;49;00m:\u001b[37m \u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[33m\"Nicky\"\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","}\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(app_reviews)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xl8HA_tRpQg3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1689644324441,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":202,"user":{"displayName":"naveen kadampally","userId":"11540917112415081866"}},"outputId":"3a4a466e-c486-4f88-f11d-b603ba717261"},"execution_count":45,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["4632"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":45}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["app_reviews_df = pd.DataFrame(app_reviews)"],"metadata":{"id":"rveeu8TQplR9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1689644378081,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":231,"user":{"displayName":"naveen kadampally","userId":"11540917112415081866"}}},"execution_count":46,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["app_reviews_df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":600},"id":"EnPo5s5PpyXb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1689644400513,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":222,"user":{"displayName":"naveen kadampally","userId":"11540917112415081866"}},"outputId":"79cfbdbc-cc3e-4859-e911-161e53f16f03"},"execution_count":48,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                               reviewId      userName  \\\n","0  1752d5cc-e67c-40e7-bf38-cda11b5630e3         Nicky   \n","1  832dd7f7-a914-4c02-ad42-b437bfc677d5  Archna Patel   \n","2  43a56d6c-9143-4bd7-a43f-7e82c64141e1    Ruth L2911   \n","3  f10324c8-64ae-445c-b819-f7786b03f19d    scouseraph   \n","4  2bed7537-026e-43b9-86d2-fc6150c757d4      Thorfinn   \n","\n","                                           userImage  \\\n","0  https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/AAcHTt...   \n","1  https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/AAcHTt...   \n","2  https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/AAcHTt...   \n","3  https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/AAcHTt...   \n","4  https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD_cM...   \n","\n","                                             content  score  thumbsUpCount  \\\n","0  I dont like the latest update.
